java1 Constructor Overload Exercise 1
======================
In this exercise, we have a closer look onto constructor overloading.

Duke has a constructor for his Cases, that takes a clue and saves it.
Now, he noticed that he also opens up new cases, for which he already has two clues.

Complement the second constructor of class **Case**. Save both clues in the array and assign an initial value of <span style="color:blue">2</span> when the overloaded constructor with two parameters is called.
