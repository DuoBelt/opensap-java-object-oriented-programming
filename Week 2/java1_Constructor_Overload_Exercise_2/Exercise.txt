java1 Constructor Overload Exercise 2
======================
In this exercise, we have a closer look onto the this keyword when using constructor overloading.

We already know that Duke has a constructor for his Cases that takes clues and saves them.
However, this time we want to do it with this, for better maintainability.

Complement the second constructor of class **Case**. Save both clues in the array and assign an initial value of <span style="color:blue">2</span> when the overloaded constructor with two parameters is called.
