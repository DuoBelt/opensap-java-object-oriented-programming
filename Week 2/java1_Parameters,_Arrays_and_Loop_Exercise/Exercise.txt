java1 Parameters, Arrays and Loop Exercise
======================
In this exercise, we access data stored within an array.

We need to be able to also retrieve the clues from the office again. 

Add the method **retrieveClue()** to the class **Office**.
The method shall receive a parameter of type int and return the respective element on that position out of the array.

Additionally, add the method **printClues()**, that prints out all elements of the array *clues* consecutively.
Use a for-loop, that uses the attribute  **.length** of array *clues*, and the method **retrieveClue()**.
