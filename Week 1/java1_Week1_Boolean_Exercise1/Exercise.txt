java1 Week1 Boolean Exercise1
======================
In this exercise, we practise the definition of booleans and boolean logic.<br>
Define two variables: *first* and *second*. Both should be of data type boolean.<br>
*first* should be **true**, *second* should be **false**.

Then, define two more boolean variables: *third* and *fourth*.<br>
Compute the result of: **first OR second**, then assign it to the variable *third*. <br>
Further, compute the result of: **first AND second** and assign the result to the variable *fourth*. <br>
Lastly, print out the variables third and fourth in separate lines.
