java1 Week1 Classes, Methods and Attributes Combined: The Password
======================
In this exercise, we repeat the definition of classes and methods, the creation of attributes, and the invocation of methods.

Detective Duke has forgotten his own computer password due to excitement about his new case.
However, when cleaning up in the office, Duke has recovered his password generator, with which he once created the password. Maybe he still finds his old password in its memory?

The **Password** class is encrypted and therefore not visible for humans.

It is only known that the class **PasswordGenerator** has a method **getPassword()**, which returns a string.

In class **Office**, create a string attribute *password* and a method **printPassword()**.

In the method **printPassword()** call the method **getPassword()** on the object of type **PasswordGenerator** and save the result in the attribute *password*.

*Hint:* Do not forget to create an actual instance of **PasswordGenerator** for that. In class office, only an attribute is declared.

Finally, print the attribute *password* in a separate line.
