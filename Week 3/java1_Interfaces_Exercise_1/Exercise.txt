java1 Interfaces Exercise 1
======================
In this exercise, we implement the example shown in the video.
In order to keep the number of classes low, we will implement a further simplified version.

Given are the three classes **Plane**, **Drone** and **Raven**.

Implement the Interface **Flyable**. It has to contain the abstract method *fly()*.

**Plane**, **Drone** and **Raven** should implement the interface **Flyable**.

The method *fly()* of class **Plane** should print out <span style="color:blue">"Wrrooom!" </span>.

The method *fly()* of class **Drone** should print out <span style="color:blue">"Beep beep!" </span>.

The method *fly()* of class **Raven** should print out <span style="color:blue">"Flap flap" </span>.

Please make the method *fly()* public.
