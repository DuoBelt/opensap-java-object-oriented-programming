java1 Overload 1
======================
This exercise is about overloading methods.
Eric needs a new calculator. A special one: *The E.Vil.Culator*

So, in class **EVilCulator** you need to implement 4 versions of the method **addition()**.

1. the first method takes 2 arguments of data type int. The method returns a value of data type int.

2. the second method takes 3 arguments of data type int. It also returns a value of data type int.

3. the third method takes 2 arguments of data type double. The method returns a value of data type double. 

4. the fourth method takes 3 arguments of data type double. The method returns a value of data type double. 

All methods sum up the values of the passed in arguments and return the result. But as it is the **EVilCulator**  they also add a service fee of **twenty** on each calculation ( and simply add it to the result).
