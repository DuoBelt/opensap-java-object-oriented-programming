java1 Encapsulation Exercise 2
======================
To enhance the safety of his car, Duke wants to encapsulate its attributes with getters and setters.

In order to help him, implement the following methods in the class **Car**:

**setEngineRunning()** should take an argument of type boolean and assign it to the attribute *isEngineRunning*.

**isEngineRunning()** should return the value of the attribute *isEngineRunning*.

Hint: The method **printStatus()** must not be changed.
