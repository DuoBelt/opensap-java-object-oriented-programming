java1 Inheritance1
======================
Examine the classes **Vehicle**, **Automobile** and **Car** and implement a suitable inheritance hierarchy. 

Hint: The expected inheritance hierarchy resembles the intuitive structure that humans are likely to build out of the given concepts.
You do not have to change the classes further than just adding the inheritance-dependencies to solve this exercise.

You can try which object delivers which output and which attributes and methods can be called from which places.  
For this, re-introduce the comments and adjust the code in the main-method as you like.
