java1 Encapsulation Exercise 1
======================
In this exercise, the class **Car** is given. It contains the attribute *remainingFuel*.
The attribute is encapsulated via getters and setters. However, it would be good to check, whether the values passed to the setter are reasonable.

Before setting the remainingFuel, it should be checked whether the passed value is in the possible range of values.

To check this, implement a private method **notNegative()** in class **Car**, that is called from within the method **setRemainingFuel()**. It should check whether the passed argument is a positive number or zero.
